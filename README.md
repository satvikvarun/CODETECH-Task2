Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

Description:

This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. Sentiment analysis is a powerful natural language processing (NLP) application widely used in understanding customer feedback, improving recommendations, and analyzing public opinions.

Objective:

To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the sentiment of a given movie review.
To preprocess and analyze textual data for better insights and performance.

Dataset:

The IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset is used for training and evaluation. It contains:
50,000 reviews: 25,000 for training and 25,000 for testing.
Reviews labeled as positive or negative.
A balanced dataset with an equal number of positive and negative reviews.

Approach:
Text Preprocessing:
Tokenization and lowercasing.
Removing stopwords and punctuation.
Converting text into numerical representation using TF-IDF.

Model Development:
Trained using logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM).
Used evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score.

Results-
The sentiment analysis model achieved:

Accuracy: 89%
Precision: 88%
Recall: 90%
F1-Score: 89%
